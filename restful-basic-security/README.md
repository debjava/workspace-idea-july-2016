=====

Introduction
============
Now a days most of the high end applications are powered by RESTful web services. It has become necessary to know the significance of RESTful web service.
Before jumping into the nitty-gritty of RESTful web service, let us learn the basics.
Through this tutorial I will provide you an insight into a basic RESTful web service creation using Spring's basic authentication and authorization.
It will also make you aware of how to create swagger documentation for RESTful web service for exposing the services. This tutorial will be
helpful for those who are new to RESTful web service. It covers all the CRUD operations involved in RESTful we service.

What does it do?
===============

#### 1) Exposure to basic http methods

It provides the all the REST end-points for the http methods **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** and **DELETE**.

#### 2) Exposure to Swagger documentation

This project provides an exposure to usage of swagger api and the creation of swagger documentation. In this project, I have used Swagger UI 2.0 version.

#### 3) Exposure to Maven multi module project

To achieve better modularity, I have used maven multi module structure which will give an outline of better project structure.

#### 4) Exposure to Spring Basic Security

This sample project will give you idea of usage of Spring Basic Authentication and Authorization.
